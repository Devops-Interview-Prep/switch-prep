Hi, I’m Pawan, a DevOps Engineer with 4 years of experience. I’ve worked with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, and set up CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployments. I’m also comfortable with Linux, Golang, and Bash scripting for automation.

In terms of observability, I’ve used Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Fluent Bit, and OpenTelemetry. I’ve worked with Kong, NGINX, and have hands-on experience across AWS and GCP cloud platforms.

My key responsibilities include managing deployments, provisioning infrastructure with Terraform, offering production support, and introducing tools that improve productivity and reliability.
