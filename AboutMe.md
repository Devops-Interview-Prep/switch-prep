Hi my name is pawan, I am from Sikar, Rajasthan
I completed my Btech in 2021 from IIT Kanpur

I have 4 years of experience in devops domain,

In my first company I worked in a team of 10 members 
There I mostly worked around developing a service in go to manage configs during runtime of the application,
Setting up the pipelines using gitlab cid, setting and managing the monitoring tools like prometheus and grafana 
managing AWS resources using terraform,  

later i joined a startup where i was alone to do all the devops tasks, so I  had to implement everything from scratch and streamlined the devops flow 
that includes setting up the deployment flows using github actions,
Setting up the terraform to create resources in multiple clouds 
worked with gcp and set up multiple aws accounts with services like vpc, eks, load balancers, route53, s3 etc.
Later built a team of 4 people and lead them 

Currently working with pinelabs, its fintech company where we get really high traffic on our infra, here I am again working with a big team and leading a team of 5 people to manage a big project.

they started this project after i joined and now it has been scaled to around 60 services and still growing.
I manage the infra management, monitoring,  deployment workflows and the production issues , recently did the setup for dr in different region
