Hi Pawan,

I hope you're doing well. I came across the Devops Engineer opening at DotPe and was immediately drawn to it. With 4 years of experience as a Devops Engineer and a strong background in Linux, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, and observability tooling, I believe I can contribute meaningfully to your platform and engineering goals.

I’d love the opportunity to connect and learn more about the role and your team. Please let me know if you’d be open to a quick chat or if there's a suitable time I can apply formally.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Pawan Saini
