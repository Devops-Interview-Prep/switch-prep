- Reasons for Leaving Previous Companies
**1. Vedantu**
Vedantu was going through a challenging phase with business not performing well, which unfortunately led to multiple rounds of layoffs. As a result, the work culture started becoming toxic and uncertain. I decided it was the right time to explore better opportunities where I could grow in a healthier environment.

**2. Narayana**
Narayana was a B2B startup where I was the sole DevOps engineer. I had the opportunity to set up and implement all DevOps processes from the ground up. After successfully building the initial infrastructure and workflows, I wanted to move to a more mature, high-scale environment where I could continue learning and take on new technical challenges.

**3. Pine Labs**
At Pine Labs, I joined to lead a major greenfield project, where I was responsible for building and implementing the infrastructure from scratch. The project has now reached a steady state, and the role has become more maintenance-focused. Since I thrive in dynamic environments with complex problems to solve, I’m now seeking the next challenging opportunity.

- Reason to Join Stable Money
Stable Money is at an exciting early-growth stage, which means there will be numerous opportunities to work on new initiatives, solve interesting problems, and make meaningful contributions. I’m particularly excited about the potential for ownership and leadership in my role, along with the chance to shape the DevOps culture and systems. This aligns well with both my skill set and career aspirations.
