In Go, defer is used to schedule a function call to be executed after the surrounding function completes.

A deferred function executes in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order when the function returns.
Multiple Deferred functions execute in reverse order (LIFO).
defer is commonly used for resource cleanup (closing files, unlocking mutexes, closing database connections, etc.).
