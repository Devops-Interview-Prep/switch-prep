- Well, you will always get benefited from modules if you implement it properly. But here are certain advantages you will get with the terraform modules -

**1. Organize configuration**    
 With modules it is always easy to navigate and it helps any developer to understand the terraform project with ease. Certain with the module you can break down very complex infrastructure modules into very simplistic terraform modules.

**2. Encapsulation**    
You can benefit from the encapsulation also and with terraform module you can hide the internal implementation of your infrastructure set up so that you can prevent unwanted changes happening to your modules by other developers.

**3. Re-usability**    
If you have broken down your infrastructure into smaller and generic modules then it would help you to re-use the modules into another infrastructure setup.

**4. Consistency**    
 Following the best practices(encapsulation, organize, simple terraform module) will help you to achieve consistent behavior across all the different environments which will help you to reduce the debugging time and reduce the infrastructure maintenance cost.
