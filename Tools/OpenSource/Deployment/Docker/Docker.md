- Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.
  
- Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows.

- Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. 

- As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.

- A container manager does lightweight virtualisation
(host and guest systems share the same kernel)

- It is based on linux namespaces and cgroups
